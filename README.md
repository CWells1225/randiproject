Hello. I am currently working on a food ordering app for a client. There will be an about component, a menu component, a checkout component, and also the option to signin. I'm pretty excited about working on this app. The client gave me her ideas and gave me creative control to work on the layout. I used figma to share ideas with the client as far as the app layout. I used ReactJS to develop this application.
